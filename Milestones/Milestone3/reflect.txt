In milestone 1, I learned how to parse data from input files (string format) and separate tokens by delimiters with the Utilities class.  I learned that the Item class can hold properties for an Item that would be used in later milestones such as quantity and subtracting quantity with the member function updateQuantity().  
In milestone 2, I learned that CustomerOrder contains items that are to be filled.  I also used std::move a few times as the copy operations for Customer order are not allowed.  I am now more familiar with how classes encapsulate information Ð the CustomerOrder class contains logic to fill orders, get order status and get item status.  
In milestone 3, I learned to draw information from sample output (Validate Tasks) and the AssemblyLine.dat file to decipher the order of the assembly line and to link the assembly line objects.   I used visual studio debugger to trace the state and values of the objects while doing Filling Orders.
